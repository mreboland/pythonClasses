# Working with classes and instances
# Once a Class is written, most of the time spent is with instances created
# with that Class. One of the first tasks we'll want to do is modify the
# attributes associated with a particular instance.
# We can modify the attributes of an instance directly or write methods that 
# update attributes in specific ways
